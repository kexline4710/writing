# The Google Cardboard Wedding Gift

To Julie and Mike,  

Here's a little something  
To capture all the things  
You love birds will discover  
After exchaning those two rings.  
The countries you will visit,  
The sites along the way,  
But most importantly the love  
That will grow between you every day.  

Congratulations!
