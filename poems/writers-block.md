# Writer's Block

My pen won't write, or so it seems,
This dark and lonely night
And though I'll soon be lost in dreams
I'll try with all my might
To tell of beauty, love, and hate
Of roses just in bloom,
Of destiny and tricky fate,
Of death and fear and gloom.
I'll write of waters far and wide
And sunsets whispering "bye..."
Of friends and family by my side
And a lover's howling cry.
I'll speak of music, song, and dance
Of art that brightens life
Of lucky stars and hopeful chance
Of disappoint and strife.
The Lord has given many things
To inspire such a rhyme
Alas, my friend, my right hand stings
And I am wasting time
For I must admit the writer's plight
That though my thoughts run deep,
I'll write no poem here tonight
And become a slave to sleep.
