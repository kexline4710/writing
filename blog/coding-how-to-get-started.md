Coding…How to get started!

Here’s the spiel I generally give to people when they ask me where they can start dabbling in the world of technology and programming. There are so many different languages and tools out there, and so many opinionated articles on the internet that it can be hard to figure out what route to take. Here are the most valuable skills and general paths available for those wishing to delve deeper into web development.

What are the things you should learn?

YOU MUST learn enough HTML/CSS and some JavaScript to get a functioning webpage. Every developer deals with it at some point and knowing these alone make you pretty darn marketable. There are several online resources out there to help you get to that point.

Start practicing getting your projects “live” or on the internet. Buy some hosting space and a domain name so you can put your website out there! If you build web apps with a DB, it’s going to take a little more setup, but there are great sites out there to help with this too.

Learn How to interact with your computer through the command line. This will become more and more important from this point on. This is a great crash course that only takes a day or two. You’ll feel like a hacker when you are done. :)

Start learning Git/GitHub at so that you can start keeping track of your projects and share your progress with people. More importantly, Git is a life saver when you mess up and need to get back to a different version of your code.

Then there are a couple routes that you can take:

​Go further down the Front End JS-focused route and learn how to build awesome interactive websites using frameworks like Angular, Backbone, or Ember. JavaScript is the cool kid on the block and isn’t going anywhere.

Go down the Front End style-focused route by learning more about HTML5, CSS3 and the specifications. You can learn how to make really well designed sites using cool CSS frameworks like SASS.

Start going down the Server-side Language route of building web applications. Learn a language like Ruby, Python or PHP and then consider learning a corresponding framework like Rails (Ruby), Djano (Python), or Cake (PHP). You can easily participate in Hackathons and start building applications at this point.

Start learning about PHP and Content Management Systems (CMS) like Wordpress so that you can build quick websites for people. This is an easy way to build a portfolio, and get experience consulting. It can be restricting, and isn’t the same as learning how to build your own applications, but Wordpress serves a purpose, and a good one at that.

Go down the Mobile route and build the next cool app everyone is talking about. Mobile is a big deal now because it is driving a lot of innovation in the tech scene right now. You can learn Java to make Android apps, or Objective C/Swift to build iOS apps, but it’s worth spending a little time to learn both.

As a side note, I am sure some will disagree with how I’ve broken things down or with my recommendations. I simply wish to break down the major sectors of our field for beginners without bogging them down in nuances and aggressive opinions and believe I’ve done my best to do so.

Cool, now what?

Go through some tutorials where you get familiar with a language or technology of your choosing and then try tutorials that get you out of your web browser and onto your own computer. Then you can start thinking about different things you want to work with and being testing out some of the different routes I mentioned to figure out what you like best. I strongly encourage you to also check out some local groups and Meetups in addition to ours. They are great way to start networking and meet people in the community that will end up being BOTH your mentors and friends. :)
